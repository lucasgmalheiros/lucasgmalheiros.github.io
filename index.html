            Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a Russian writer that is considered by many, including me, the greatest author 
            of all time. In this page I will post his books that I have read. The links from Amazon are not for my profit,
            as the books were written more than 100 years ago they are in public domain, so you can read all of them for free.<br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>: Fyodor Mikhailovich
            Dostoevsky; 11 November 1821 – 9 February 1881, sometimes transliterated as
            Dostoyevsky, was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and journalist. Dostoevsky's literary works
            explore the human condition in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia,
            and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include Crime and
            Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). His 1864 novella, Notes
            from Underground, is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature. Numerous literary
            critics regard him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of his works are
            considered highly influential masterpieces.

            It was the first Dostoyevsky's book I have read. It has almost 1000 pages but is so cool
            that can be read in less than a week (I am not exaggerating). <br>
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Brothers-Karamazov" target="_blank">Summary</a>: "The Brothers 
            Karamazov, the final novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, first published as Bratya Karamazovy in 1879–80 and generally
            considered to be his masterpiece. It is the story of Fyodor Karamazov and his sons Alyosha, Dmitry, and Ivan. 
            It is also a story of patricide, into the sordid unfolding of which Dostoyevsky introduces a love-hate struggle 
            with profound psychological and spiritual implications."

            This certainly was Dostoyevsky's book that took me more time to read. It does not mean
            that it was bad, it is really great indeed, but it is a hard story to digest. <br>
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Crime-and-Punishment-novel" target="_blank">Summary</a>: "Crime and
             Punishment, Russian Prestupleniye i nakazaniye, novel by Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, first published in 1866.
              His first masterpiece, the novel is a psychological analysis of the poor former student Raskolnikov, whose theory
               that he is an extraordinary person able to take on the spiritual responsibility of using evil means to achieve
                humanitarian ends leads him to murder. The act produces nightmarish guilt in Raskolnikov. The story is one of the
                 finest studies of the psychopathology of guilt written in any language."

            The first part of this book clearly influenced Nietzsche's way of writing, as the "Man from the Underground" 
            exposes his thoughts about life and human condition. <br>
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Notes-from-the-Underground" target="_blank">Summary</a>: "Notes from the
             Underground, novella by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, first published in Russian as Zapiski iz podpolya in 1864. The work,
              which includes extremely misanthropic passages, contains the seeds of nearly all of the moral, religious,
               political, and social concerns that appear in Dostoyevsky's great novels."

            This short book is a great introduction to his works. It was the last one that I have read. <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Nights_(short_story)" target="_blank">Summary</a>: "'White Nights' is a
             short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky, originally published in 1848, early in the writer's career. Like many of 
             Dostoevsky's stories, "White Nights" is told in the first person by a nameless narrator. The narrator is a young man
              living in Saint Petersburg who suffers from loneliness. He gets to know and falls in love with a young woman, but
               the love remains unrequited as the woman misses her lover, with whom she is finally reunited."
